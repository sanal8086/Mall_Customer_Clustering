# Mall_Customer_Clustering

## Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

- This repository contains the code and data for a customer segmentation project using K-Means clustering on the Mall Customers dataset.

- The goal of this project is to identify groups of customers with similar characteristics and spending habits. This information can be 
  used by businesses to target their marketing campaigns and improve their customer service.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Installation

## Dataset
- The dataset contains the following columns:

- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
- Genre: Customer's gender
- Age: Customer's age
- Annual Income (k$): Customer's annual income in thousands of dollars
- Spending Score (1-100): Customer's spending score on a scale of 1 to 100
  
## Results

- The results of this project can be used by businesses to target their marketing campaigns and improve their customer service. For 
 example, businesses could use the cluster labels to identify groups of customers with similar spending habits. They could then target 
 these groups with specific marketing campaigns.

- Businesses could also use the cluster centroids to learn more about the different groups of customers. For example, they could compare 
 the centroids of different clusters to identify the average age, income, and spending habits of each group.
